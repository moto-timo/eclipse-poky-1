Developer's Workspace Setup

This readme describes how to setup a development environment for developming
and testing the eclipse-poky plugins.

For the time being we recommend using Linux for eclipse-poky development,
so all of the instructions below should be done on an appropriate Linux distribution.

Prerequisites

1) Install Java Development Kit (jdk) 8+.

If you already have Java 8+ installed on your system you can
skip to step 2.  To check type:

$ java -version

and if it responds with

java version "1.8.0_102"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_102-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.102-b14, mixed mode)

With a version >= 1.8.0 then you already have what you need.

If not installed, download from:

https://java.com/en/download/

and install as appropriate for your system.

Other impls may be used if desired, but they must support JDK 8.

2) Install Maven

If you already have Maven 3.3.9+ installed you may skip to
step 3.

If not installed, download from:

http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

Install instructions are here

http://maven.apache.org/install.html

2a) Configure Maven for Proxy

If you have a proxy, see

https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html
and
https://maven.apache.org/settings.html

and consult your local network admin for the appropriate proxy info.

2) Install Eclipse

a) Download Eclipse Oxygen.2 or more recent release.   For poky plugin development
three  components are required:   i) Eclipse Java SDK, ii) Eclipse PDE;
iii) Maven 2 Eclipse (m2e).   All three of these components are present in
the package named 'Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers'.  All of the packages
are listed here:

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages

Download the 'Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers' and expand into a new directory
(e.g. ~/eclipse.oxygen.2) on your local disk.

3) Clone the eclipse-poky git repo

By default, eclipse's git client (egit) uses ~/git for accessing git repos, so it's
generally a good idea to create and use ~/git for the following clone command.

In ~git type:

$ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/eclipse-poky-contrib

When complete, change to the timo/maven branch (temporary)

$ git checkout timo/maven

4) Import Project Set into Eclipse workspace

Open a terminal, navigate to ~/eclipse.oxygen.2 and type:

$ ./eclipse

Create a new workspace (e.g. workspace.eclipse-poky)

From main menu:

File->Import...->Team->Team Project Set->Next

Select File radio button and choose 'Browse' button on right

Browse to ~/git/eclipse-poky-contrib/releng/org.yocto.sdk.releng/projectsets

and choose 'pokywithrse.psf' and Finish

This should result in approximately 11 projects appearing in
your workspace.  Some will have compiler errors.

5) Resolve Target Platform

In the Eclipse Package Explorer view (or Projects view) navigate
to org.yocto.sdk.releng/targets directory and open (double click)
this file:  pokywithrse.target

Once this file is opened, you should see in the message bar: "Resolving
Poky with R...inition" with a percentage.  This will take some time
(possibly minutes depending upon the speed of your internet connection)

When the resolving is complete, choose 'Set as Target Platform' link in
upper right of the Target Definition Editor.  This should result in
the workspace projects being rebuilt without errors.
